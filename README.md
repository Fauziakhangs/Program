## ðŸ§® Simple Calculator Program
This is a fun and interactive Python-based calculator program. It allows users to input values, performs basic calculations, and displays the results. The project also includes functionality to build and send HTTP requests and demonstrates how to handle both successful and failed responsesâ€”perfect for learning how to combine logic with basic API interaction.

## ðŸ”§ Features
Accepts user inputs (e.g., numbers and operators)

Builds a URL and sends a GET request (if applicable)

Handles both successful and error responses gracefully

Extracts and displays relevant data from the response

## ðŸ“š Concepts Practiced
This project also includes hands-on practice with key Python and NumPy concepts:

### NumPy Fundamentals

#### Type Casting: Converting array elements to a specific data type

Working with arrays for data manipulation

### Python Chaining Techniques

#### Attribute chaining: Accessing multiple attributes in a single expression

Method chaining: Calling multiple methods on the same object
